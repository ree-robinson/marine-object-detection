Underwater Object Detection
Overview
This project focuses on underwater object detection using deep learning techniques, primarily utilizing the Faster R-CNN model from the PyTorch library. The model is trained to detect various underwater species, such as fish, jellyfish, penguins, puffins, sharks, starfish, and stingrays from video footage, with the objective of enhancing marine life monitoring and research.
Features
•	Multi-Class Detection: Supports detection of multiple underwater species.
•	Bounding Box Annotation: Visual representation of detected objects in the video frames.
•	Efficient Data Loading: Optimized data handling for large underwater datasets.
•	Colab Integration: Easy-to-use with Google Colab for quick experimentation and scalability.
Dataset
The dataset is organized into three main directories:
•	train: Contains training images and corresponding annotations.
•	valid: Contains validation images and annotations.
•	test: Contains test images and annotations.
Classes:
•	Fish
•	Jellyfish
•	Penguin
•	Puffin
•	Shark
•	Starfish
•	Stingray
Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To train the model:
python train.py --data /path/to/dataset
To run inference on a video:
python inference.py --video /path/to/video.mp4
Visualization
Bounding boxes are drawn on the detected objects using OpenCV. You can visualize images with annotations using:
visualize_image_with_annotation_bounding_boxes(image_dir, label_dir)
Model
The object detection model is based on Faster R-CNN with transfer learning from a pre-trained ResNet backbone. The RPN (Region Proposal Network) identifies candidate object regions which are then classified and refined.
